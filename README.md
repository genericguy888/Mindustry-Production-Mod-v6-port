# Mindustry-Production-Mod-v6-port
Mod converted to v6. Notable differences: Modded drones removed, some missing textures on drills because i honestly don't know how to texture.
Approved by What42Pizza. Check the issues on his mod. What42Pizza, if you find it disatisfactory, you can tell me to take it down if you want.
will be deleted if he makes a official v6 port however
